# JavaScript Coding Quiz
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Project Description:
* This is a JavaScript coding quiz that tests the user's knowledge of beginner-level JavaScript facts. Upon opening the application, the user is guided to the Start Page, which provides play instructions, a Start Quiz button, and a View Highscores button.
* Upon clicking the Start Quiz button, the user will be guided to the Quiz Page, where they will be presented with a question and four possible answers. As they answer each question, the user will see that their answer choice was either correct or incorrect, a new question will appear, right answers will increase their score, and wrong answers will incur a time penalty of 5 seconds. The question order is randomized for each play-through. The page is also designed to display the user's stats (current question, score, and time remaining). If the timer reaches 0, the user will be brought to the Game Over Page, and will have the option to try the quiz again. If they are able to answer all ten questions within the time limit, the user will be redirected to a Highscore Submissions page. Here, they can enter their name into the input box, click the Save button, and save their score to be viewed again. Upon being redirected to the View Highscores Page, the user can see all of their previous scores (and delete them if they so desire). Highscores are displayed in order from oldest (top) to newest (bottom).
